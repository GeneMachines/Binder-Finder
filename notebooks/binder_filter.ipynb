    "# Binder discovery from publicly available data\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop a semi-automated search for existing binders for particular targets. This approach will combine a sequence-based search to identify scaffolds of interest with a text based search of annotations for the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "### Functionality\n",
    "Major features to be implimented in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* database selection (pdb, patents, nr– dropdown)\n",
    "* scaffold selection (possibly dropdown or hmm or pfam id, eg V<sub>H</sub>H/PF07686)\n",
    "* annotation search (keyword input)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if target is a also a protein, check to see if co-crystal structure exists in pdb\n",
    "* differentiate V<sub>H</sub>H from S<sub>C</sub>F<sub>V</sub>, FAB, and full-length IgG antibodies (length, presence/absence of constant domains)\n",
    "* expand text search to include multiple sources (patent contents/associated papers etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database selection\n",
    "This should be the easiest to implement. Download data and set up searchable database. Select by identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaffold selection\n",
    "This can be done in a couple of ways. If only pre-defined options exist then searches can be pre-computed and a reduced dataset provided for each scaffold selection. If the user provides an hmm or pfam id, this lookup will have to be performed on the fly using a call to hmmsearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting for antibody subtypes could be difficult. The v-set pfam ([PF07686](pfam.xfam.org/family/PF07686)) will match any IgG-like variable region. Selecting by domain architectures might be difficult as distinguishing between truncated sequences and true antibody fragments might be impossible. The data annotations may have to be relied upon for this or the burden passed to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption should be tested by building a curated model of each scaffold of interest and searching against the database, scoring the fidelity with which that specific scaffold is returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotation search\n",
    "This will be the trickiest. Ideally an advanced search will be used which takes synonyms into account as well as misspellings. Also, what can be searched will depend on which database is being searched. There are vastly different data associated with each of the PDB and patent databases. The best solution might be to use an existing API to leverage the advanced search functionality. Examples might be the [Google search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/) together with the patent database flag, \"&tbm=pts\"; the EMBL-EBI [ENA API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/service-news/new-ena-discovery-api); or [pyPDB](https://github.com/williamgilpin/pypdb) a python API for the RCSB PDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining filters\n",
    "#### Patent database\n",
    "Patents have a unique identifier. This identifier is returned in a list by most text searches. By performing the text search via an API, the list of returned patent applications can be compared against the list of patents containing sequences of interest.  \n",
    "There are multiple patent resources. EMBL-EBI provoides a database of patent sequences. Google scholar and The Lens provide searches of the patent literature. The Lens also provides some ability to access sequences associated with those patents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDB database\n",
    "As above, except the unique identifier is the pdb id. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMGT antibody database\n",
    "This is already a highly curated database so all that needs to be done is to perform a text search. \n",
    "\n"

    "#### Building HMMs from curated sets of antibody scaffolds\n",
    "In order to test whether antibody structures can be differentiated from sequence alone HMMs were built using curated sets of each type. \n",
    "\n",
    "A curated set was produced by accessing the IMGT database and restricting the search terms to the scaffold of interest, for example by selecting \"scFv\" under \"other keywords\". This produced 447 sequences, all of which were exported and then aligned using muscle:\n",

    "The aligned sequences were then visualised in geneious and especially long or truncated sequences were removed. This resulted in 226 full-length ScFv sequences. These were then translated using BioPython and filtered for sequences with internal stop-codons:\n",
    "\n",

    "from Bio import SeqIO, Seq\n",
    "h = \"/Users/j.parker/working_dir/binder_filter/scfv/imgt-aligned-scfvs_extracts.fasta\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This HMM was then used to search the PDB and the results visually checked to make sure the significant results were predominantly ScFv sequences and not V<sub>H</sub>H or full-length monoclonal antibodies.

This is probably not a problem or surprising as diaboides are similar to ScFvs with different connectivity, and is a burden that can be shifted to the user.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the V<sub>H</sub>Hs, a length filter of 250aa was also applied to exclude full-length and longer fragment antibodies which reduced the dataset from 140061 to 118448 sequences.\n",
